          <h1><span>CAT,</span>The Cutest Animal</h1>
          <p>
            The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
            mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
              Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the
              light level required for human vision.[63]: 43  This is partly the
              result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any
              light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby
              increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.[79] Large pupils
              are an adaptation to dim light.

            <h2>Hearing</h2>
            <p>
              The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to
              32 kHz.[84] It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies
              ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect
              frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5
              octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.

            <h2>Smell</h2>
            <p>
              Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their
              well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory
              mucosa, about 5.8 square centimetres (29⁄32 square inch) in area,
              which is about twice that of humans.[90] Cats and many other
              animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in
              the behavioral process of flehmening. It allows them to sense
              certain aromas in a way that humans cannot.
